Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
In my project, I used a single-page application (SPA) with Express, HTML, and JavaScript to create a smoother user experience. Unlike traditional multi-page apps, the SPA updated content dynamically without full page reloads, making navigation faster and more efficient.

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database because it allowed for flexible data storage with JSON-like documents, making it easier to handle trip details without a strict schema. It also scaled well and worked efficiently with the single-page application by quickly retrieving and updating data.

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON is a data format used for storing and exchanging data, while JavaScript is a programming language used to build interactive web applications. JSON ties the frontend and backend together by allowing them to send and receive structured data, making it easy for the backend to store information and the frontend to display it dynamically.

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
I refactored code when optimizing how trips were displayed by reducing redundant API calls and improving state management in the SPA. Reusable UI components, like buttons and forms, made the app more efficient by keeping the design consistent and reducing the amount of repeated code, making updates easier.

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
Methods like GET and POST define how data is requested or sent between the frontend and backend through API endpoints. Endpoints are specific URLs where the frontend interacts with the backend, like retrieving trip details or submitting login credentials. Security adds complexity to testing because authentication, authorization, and data validation must be verified to prevent unauthorized access or data leaks.

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
I recently purchased my own server and have been messing around with building a website. This course has taught me so many different ways to do what I have already done, but much more efficiently. I cannot wait to use my newfound knowledge to build my website into something I never thought I would be able to do!
